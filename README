This script may be useful if you have a 3D model in FreeCAD
and want to lasercut it in segments to glue or stick together somehow.

To use, try something like this:

1. Run bisectCrossSections(object, thickness) in FreeCAD on object
2. Select all objects in the Solid_Slices group
3. Export to flattened SVG
4. Import to Inkscape
5. Select all with Ctrl-A
6. Choose Object->Ungroup (Shift-Ctrl-G)
7. Add a box the size of your plate to cut from, and lower box (Object->Lower to bottom)
8. Save as SVG from inkscape
9. Open SVGNest, load SVG
10. Select the box you added, and click "Start Nest"
11. Leave running until satisfied, save SVG and lasercut result

If you have a mesh and not a solid, you can try to convert it using this method:
